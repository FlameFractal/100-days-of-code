### Day 1: Sep 1, Sunday

Browsed [Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/documentation/jsongraph.html) docs. It's a REST alternative based on different data modelling idea of JSON Graphs. It's built and maintained by Netflix. 

I've been interested in REST alternatives since I learned about [Hasura](https://hasura.io) pivoting to a GraphQL based product. I experimented with GraphQL using their GraphiQL interface. Falcor is different in the sense that 1. it's more of a convention and 2. it's a middleware rather than replacing your BE. GraphQL is by Facebook while Falcor is by Netflix. Both are strong engineering companies with some limited OSS contributions.
